# Minichess AI Project

## Project Description

Minichess is a simplified, shorter version of Chess played on a 6 x 5 board. This project involves developing an AI program that can effectively play Minichess against a human or another AI opponent. The project aims to showcase the use of search algorithms, game tree exploration, and strategic decision-making using advanced algorithms like Minimax with alpha-beta pruning. Additionally, the project includes the development of a user interface for interaction.

## Project Requirements

### Core Features

- **Game Tree Search**: Implementation of a suitable search algorithm for exploring the game tree.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Running the minimax algorithm on the game tree to determine the optimal move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implementation of alpha-beta pruning to enhance the efficiency of the search process by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
- **Evaluation Function**: Design and implementation of an effective evaluation function to assess the quality of intermediate game states.
- **Early Stopping Mechanism**: Inclusion of an early stopping mechanism to enable the AI to abort the search process and return the minimax value based on the evaluation function.

### Additional Features

- **User Interface**: A functional user interface for gameplay. An aesthetic or graphical user interface is encouraged and will earn extra credits.
- **Version Control**: The project must be maintained using Git or a similar version control system.

## Objectives

- Develop a computer program capable of playing Minichess effectively against a human or another AI.
- Implement the minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.
- Design a robust evaluation function to estimate the strength of board positions.
- Create a user-friendly interface for gameplay interaction.
- Maintain comprehensive project documentation and version control through a Git repository.

## Key Components
